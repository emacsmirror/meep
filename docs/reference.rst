.. BEGIN VARIABLES

Custom Variables
----------------

``meep-mark-set-on-motion``: ``t``
   Motion sets the mark.

``meep-state-insert-register``: ``94``
   The register set when leaving insert mode.

   Used by ``meep-insert-last`` which will enter insert mode at this location.

``meep-move-comment-skip-space``: ``t``
   When navigating comment bounds, skip leading/trailing space.

``meep-move-comment-skip-repeated``: ``t``
   When navigating comment bounds, skip repeated characters.

``meep-region-swap-imply-region``: ``t``
   Imply the region from the length of the secondary region.

   - When the region on a single line:
     The text after point implies the selection.
   - When a line-wise region is used:
     The same number of lines after the point is used (ignoring line length).
   - When a rectangle-wise region is used:
     The text after & lines below are used to create the implied selection.

``meep-isearch-activate-mark``: ``t``
   ISearch activates the mark (transient).
   So motion drops the selection.

   Useful for pasting while stepping over search results.


Other Variables
---------------

``meep-state-region-elem``: ``nil``
   Supported values are symbols nil or 'line-wise.

   Note that line-wise navigation is not enforced,
   this is a hint that commands may use.

``meep-mark-set-on-motion-override``: ``nil``
   This constant exists so itâ€™s possible to let-bind the value to t.

   Used so a motion can be repeated without setting the mark.

``meep-move-by-sexp-over-depth``: ``nil``
   The target depth when moving over S-expressions.
   Used to maintain the depth even when moving over causes
   navigation to move to outer scope.

   Only used between successive
   ``meep-move-by-sexp-over-next`` & ``meep-move-by-sexp-over-prev`` calls.

``meep-delete-char-ring``: ``nil``
   Deleted characters.
   Used by ``meep-delete-char-ring-next``, ``meep-delete-char-ring-prev`` &
   ``meep-delete-char-ring-yank``.

``meep-clipboard-register-map``: ``(keymap)``
   Clipboard to use for the register-clipboard.

   Used by ``meep-clipboard-register-map``.


Commands
--------

Motion: Symbol/Word
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Command properties:
commands may have a `meep' property, this is expected to be a P-list of properties.

:mark-on-motion
   - t: Mark on motion.
   - 'adjust: Adjust the previous motion.

     This is used so a motion can be adjusted,
     without breaking the chain of commands used to repeat an action.
     So it's possible to perform a motion & any number of adjustments before an edit-command.

     When repeating the motion, adjustments and edit will all be repeated.
     Single character motion commands take advantage of this.

   - nil: don't mark on motion (same as missing).

:mark-on-motion-no-repeat
   - t: These motions that should not be repeated such as search.
     (used by repeat-fu).
:digit-repeat
   - t: The command is a digit command.

   via ``meep-exchange-point-and-mark``.

``(meep-region-toggle)``

   use to maintain line-based selection.

Selection/Region: Expand/Contract

a syntax mismatch is encountered, then expanding is only performed at the point.

This allows for expanding across surrounding symmetrical characters which can be useful.

   Expand on matching syntax table elements.

``(meep-region-syntax-contract)``
   Contract matching syntax table.

Command: Repeat N

   surround each line individually.
   When there is no active region, surround the current line.

Text Editing: Join Lines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Line joining with support for left-trimming code-comments,
so this may be used to conveniently joining lines in code.

For an example of languages using ``#`` prefixed comments (Python or Shell):

.. code-block:: python

   # Example block.
   # Next line.

Joined at the first line removes the leading ``#``:

.. code-block:: python

   # Example block. Next line.

And for C-family languages:

.. code-block:: c

   /* Example block.
    * next line. */

Joined at the first line removes the leading ``*``:

   Join the next line to this one ARG times.

``(meep-join-line-prev ARG)``

Text Editing: Tab Wrapper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``(meep-indent-rigidly)``
   Indent the active region or the current line.

State: Insert

   The region may be implied, see ``meep-command-is-mark-set-on-motion-any``.

``(meep-insert-change-lines)``
   Change the region, entering insert mode.
   The region may be implied, see ``meep-command-is-mark-set-on-motion-any``.

``(meep-insert-into-last)``
   Insert text into last insert point.

``(meep-insert-open-above)``
   Open a newline above and switch to INSERT state.

``(meep-insert-open-below)``
   Open a newline below and switch to INSERT state.

``(meep-insert-line-beginning)``
   Move the line indentation start and switch to INSERT state.

``(meep-insert-line-end)``
   Move the line end and switch to INSERT state.

Clipboard: System Only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These commands only wrap the "systems" clipboard,
without mixing the kill-ring or primary clipboard - for predictable results.

``(meep-clipboard-only-copy)``
   Copy the region using the clipboard-only.

``(meep-clipboard-only-cut)``
   Cut the region using the clipboard-only.

``(meep-clipboard-only-cut-line)``
   Cut the whole line using the clipboard-only.

``(meep-clipboard-only-yank-with-indent)``
   Yank from the clipboard-only, replacing the region (indenting the content).

``(meep-clipboard-only-yank)``
   Yank from the clipboard-only, replacing the region (as lines).

Clipboard: Kill Ring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These commands wrap the kill-ring, without mixing the system clipboard.

Note that line-wise cut/copy is stored in the kill-ring.
Yanking (pasting) a line-wise region yanks from the line beginning.

So line-wise kill & yank can be used to operate on lines without the need
to place the point at the beginning of the line.

If you wish to override this behavior, you may activate the region with an empty range,
since an active region always defines the range.

Note that rect-wise regions are also stored in the kill-ring and paste from the top-left.

``(meep-clipboard-killring-cut)``
   Kill the current region.
   The region need not be active.

``(meep-clipboard-killring-copy)``
   Add the current region to the ``kill-ring``.
   The region need not be active.

``(meep-clipboard-killring-cut-line)``
   Kill the whole line.

``(meep-clipboard-killring-copy-line)``
   Copy the whole line to the kill ring.

``(meep-clipboard-killring-yank-pop-stack ARG)``
   Yank from the ARG'th item from the ``kill-ring`` which is rotated.

   Rotating the kill ring means that you may kill multiple items,
   then conveniently yank those items afterwards.

``(meep-clipboard-killring-yank ARG)``
   Yank from the ARG'th item from the ``kill-ring``.
   The region is replaced (when active).

Clipboard: Register
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``(meep-clipboard-register-actions)``
   Set the pre-defined register to use for ``meep-clipboard-register-*`` commands.

   Uses the ``meep-clipboard-register-map`` key-map.

   Copy to pre-defined register.

``(meep-clipboard-register-cut)``
   Cut to pre-defined register.

``(meep-clipboard-register-yank)``
   Yank from pre-defined register.

``(meep-clipboard-register-yank-lines)``
   Yank from pre-defined register as lines.

Keypad Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^

Support entering a sequence of keys without the need to hold modifiers, see:
`keypad mode <https://github.com/meow-edit/meow/blob/master/TUTORIAL.org#keypad>`__.

``(meep-keypad)``
   Begin entering a key sequence.
